            HYPERTEXT
        </h1>
        <h2>Visualizing conversation through expressive type. <br> Kii Kang and Megan Prakash</h2>
        <p> Our dataset is speech audio extracted from a conversation between immigrant parents vs
            1st generation americans that is about 25 minutes long. The conversation is very warm and even-keeled,
            but there are a lot of complex sentiments expressed on both sides. </p>
        <p>
            For our final project, we are exploring an interactive and expressive visualization that encodes more
            than just the words that the speakers said during their conversation. In reality, a person's speech has
            higher dimensions, including volume, inflection, and sentiment. We are experimenting with the
            expressive affordances of text by encoding these higher dimensions to create <i>hypertext.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal to create a visualization for the <i>paralanguage</i>
            of the conversation: what the speakers convey outside
            of just the words they're saying.
        </p>
        <p style="color:blue">
            Implementation status: <br>
            The final design will have a full collection of quotes from the conversation, with the font identifying the speaker.
            The user can click on theme buttons ("family" is below) which will reorganize the quotes by the common themes
            expressed in the conversation, grouped by nucleus phrases that describe the sentiment in each quote. This grouping
            is juxtaposed with the identity of who spoke each quote. <br>
            At any time, the user can click a quote and trigger the animated visualization of the quote's prosody.<br>
            We plan to have the quotes animated when they move, to make it clear that the same quotes are being
            rearranged.
            The text animation and the quotes data  are of course still in progress.
